''' 
If a sequence of words is sorted, then each adjacent word of the sequence must also be sorted.

\U0001f449 Lexicographically Sorted when -
    ✦ If at first mismatch, mp[a[i]] < mp[b[i]], or
    ✦ If each letters of both words match and length(a) <= length(b)

\U0001f449 Not Lexicographically Sorted when -
    ✦ If at first mismatch, mp[a[i]] > mp[b[i]], or
    ✦ If each letters of both words match and length(a) > length(b).

        ind = {c:i for i,c in enumerate(order)}

            return len(w1) <= len(w2)
        
        return all(checkOrder(w1, w2) for w1, w2 in zip(words, words[1:]))

✦ Time Complexity : O(N),   where N is the total number of characters in words.

✦ Space Complexity : O(1),  we only need constant amount of space to store the mapping of letters to index which does not depend on the size of input. Hence we get constant space complexity.
